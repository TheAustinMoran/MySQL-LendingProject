# Lending Project Overview

# I created a database filled with typical data that a mortgage lender would use. This database could serve as perfect replica for databases used by mortgage lenders.

# The overall database is titled Lending. The main table in this database is titled Loans which contains sample data for 100 mortgage loans. 
# Along with the main Loans table, there is a Branches table containing information on specific locations where the loans were done within the whole organization.
# Three more tables include a Loan Officers table containing information on the loan officers who worked with the borrowers from start to finish on each loan. A Loan Processors table which lists loan processors who have the task of assisting loan officers with gathering back end items such as appraisals and updating specific parts of applications after the initial submission. And an Underwriters table which lists underwriters who would review and approve all loans.

# My example Lending database was created in MySQL. Sample loan data uploaded to the Loans table came from an excel workbook. All other data used in the other tables was created with Insert statements in MySQL.

# All queries were ran in MySQL. Many of the queries I created are great examples of the kind of information a lending company would want to extract from a database such as this.
